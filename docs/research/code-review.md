## Notes
- Reviews must evaluate design, functionality, complexity, tests, naming, comments, style, and documentation updates to maintain quality. [Link](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/)
- Approvals should be granted when a change measurably improves overall code health even if not perfect; reviewers prioritize continuous improvement and unblock progress. [Link](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/standard.html)
- Keep changes small, resolve feedback rapidly, and ensure every change includes adequate testing to support quick rollbacks and knowledge sharing. [Link](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch09.html)
